### ‚úÖ **Assignment: SARS-CoV-2 RNA Mathematical Modeling and 3D Visualization**

#### üî¨ **Objective:**

To model the **single-stranded RNA structure** of SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) using parametric mathematical equations and visualize it using Python. The model should also estimate the length of the RNA curve over the interval $0 < t < 3$.


### üìå **Mathematical Model**

Given parametric equations for RNA:

* $x(t) = \sqrt{8} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos(2t)}{\sqrt{2}}}$
* $y(t) = \sqrt{8} \cdot \sin(t + 90^\circ)$
* $z(t) = t$

Note:

* Convert 90¬∞ to radians: $90^\circ = \frac{\pi}{2}$

### üìä **Output**

* **3D continuous line plot** showing RNA path.
* **Estimated RNA structure length** from $t=0$ to $t=3$ units is displayed in console.

# SARS-CoV-2 RNA Mathematical Modeling & 3D Visualization

## Objective
This assignment aims to mathematically model the single-stranded RNA structure of the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) virus and visualize it using a 3D plot. The visualization is based on a set of given parametric equations.

## Description
- Images obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific‚Ñ¢ TEM and RNA schematics were used to understand the virus structure.
- The RNA trajectory is modeled using the following parametric equations:


x(t) = ‚àö8 \* sqrt((1 - cos(2t)) / ‚àö2)
y(t) = ‚àö8 \* sin(t + 90¬∞)
z(t) = t


- The Python script:
- Calculates the coordinates for the RNA model.
- Uses numerical integration (Simpson's rule) to estimate the curve length from t = 0 to t = 3.
- Plots a smooth 3D visualization using `matplotlib`.

## Tools Used
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## Output
- A 3D plot of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA structure
- Estimated RNA curve length: ~`<value>` units

## How to Run
1. Install required packages:
 ```bash
 pip install numpy matplotlib scipy

2. Run the Python script in any IDE or notebook environment.
